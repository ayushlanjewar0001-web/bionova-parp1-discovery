===================

Papyrus is an aggregated dataset of small molecule bioactivities.

Changes since version 05.6
    - ChEMBL data was updated to ChEMBL version 34
    - data of the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY has been included
    - data of Pickett et al.'s publication on MMP-12 has been included (ACS Med Chem Lett. 2011 Jan 13; 2(1): 28–33. DOI: 10.1021/ml100191f)

The very high-quality Papyrus++ data is contained in the 
05.7++_combined_set_without_stereochemistry.tsv.xz file.

The other data is split into 3 tab-separated files:
    - 05.7_combined_set_without_stereochemistry.tsv.xz
        This file contains the highly standardized and normalized data.
        Although not containing stereochemistry, it provides the second
        highest quality of the data (after Papyrus++). This file can be readily used.
    - 05.7_combined_set_with_stereochemistry.tsv.xz
        This file contains standardized and normalized activity values
        but molecules are not standardized. It is of lower confidence than
        the data above although containing stereochemistry.
        By "molecules are not standardized" we mean that sources have
        applied different standardization processes and the reported
        stereochemistry may vary for the molecule the activities relate to.
        It is recommended to standardize the data before using it.
    - 05.7_combined_set_protein_targets.tsv.xz
        This file contains data about protein targets (e.g. sequence, organism,
        classification).

In addition to these, molecular structures are available in SDfile format:
    - 05.7_combined_2D_set_without_stereochemistry.sd.xz
        This file contains the unique molecules found in
        05.7_combined_set_without_stereochemistry.tsv.xz
    - 05.7_combined_3D_set_with_stereochemistry.sd.xz
        This file contains the unique molecules found in
        05.7_combined_set_with_stereochemistry.tsv.xz

Description of the data in Papyrus:
    The 05.7_combined_set_protein_targets.tsv.xz file contains the following columns:

                            accessions and mutations
                            (e.g. P47747_WT or P10721_V559D_T670I).
        - TID               The original protein identifier.
                            It results from the concatenation of
